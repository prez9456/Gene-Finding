# Gene-Finding
In class we defined an Open Reading Frame (ORF) as a substring of DNA that starts with a start codon, ends with a stop codon, with no stop codon in the middle, and whose length is a multiple of 3. Write a program to look for long open reading frames in DNA sequences. Note that ORFs can overlap!

Using your program, analyze the DNA sequences of the following organisms:

The ebola virus.
The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. H. influenzae was the first genome of a living organism (as opposed to a virus) to be sequenced. Here's a link to the publication describing the sequencing effort.
The bacterium E. coli.
For each of these, download the genome in fasta format, and report on the number of long ORFs (longer than 100 codons) that you found with your program. Compare your findings to the number of genes that organism has. For the ebola virus, you can verify the positions of the ORFs individually by comparing them to what you see in the in the Ebola virus genome browser at UCSC. What can you say about the accuracy of this method based on your experiments?
